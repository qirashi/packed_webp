# packed_webp [RU](README.md) | [EN]
 A console utility for unpacking and packing .packed.webp.

### Usage

1. Upload `riff.exe` or unpack the archive with the utility to a convenient location.
2. Unpack the processed `webp` file with extr from `dvpl`.
3. Drag and drop one or more processed files to `riff.exe `.
   - It is possible to work with files through the console!
   - The packing process works exactly the same way. (The `.txt` files being created are also read.)
